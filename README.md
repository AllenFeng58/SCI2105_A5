      The Abstract for the project
the implementation for a Simple Calculator

this is my first repository for csi2105_A5

basied on A3 , I extend it's functions. The new function is as follows:
support the double operating( In A3 only support integer operating;
add an arithmetic operator, power, and a backspace key.
Now my calculator has operating add,subtract ,multiplay,devid power and
model. other function, clear and backspace. 
After an arithmentic expression input, press "=" to get the final result.
It can test zero as devidor and expression error.
It is only simple arithmetic ecpression.
